# Pytudes
Inspired by [Norvig](https://github.com/norvig/pytudes), I've created this repository to collect Python programs I wrote for practice only. 

> "An étude (a French word meaning study) is an instrumental musical composition, usually short, of considerable difficulty, and designed to provide practice material for perfecting a particular musical skill." — [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C3%89tude)
>
> This project contains pytudes—Python programs for perfecting programming skills.
